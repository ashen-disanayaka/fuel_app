User interface design 
UI (user interface) design refers to the design of the front-end of a mobile application, specifically how it looks and how the user interacts with it. UX (user experience) design, on the other hand, is concerned with how the user feels while interacting with the application. Both UI and UX design are important considerations when creating a mobile application, as they can greatly affect the usability and appeal of the application.
Some key considerations for UI design in a mobile application include layout, navigation, and visual design. The layout should be organized in a way that makes it easy for users to find what they are looking for and complete tasks. Navigation should be intuitive and straightforward, with clear labels and hierarchy. Visual design should be visually appealing and consistent, with a cohesive color scheme and typography therefore, yellow color selected for design main base color in this fuel app project.
For UX design, it is important to consider the overall experience of using the application, including factors such as ease of use, speed, and enjoyment. It is also important to consider the context in which the application will be used, such as whether it will be used primarily on a phone or tablet, and in what environment (e.g. outdoors, in a car, etc.).
In summary, UI design is focused on the aesthetics and functionality of the front-end of the fuel mobile application, while UX design is concerned with the overall experience of using the application. Both are important for creating a successful this mobile application project.

Front end Development 
Flutter is a mobile application development framework that uses the Dart programming language. The Flutter framework includes a variety of built-in components, widgets and visual effects, that could use to build this fuel mobile app.
In terms of algorithms and data structures, Flutter uses many of the same algorithms and data structures that you would use when building any other type of mobile app. This includes things like sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and data structures like lists, queues, and trees.
One algorithm that is commonly used in Flutter is the rendering algorithm, which is responsible for rendering the visual components of the app on the screen. This algorithm involves breaking down the app's user interface into a tree of widgets, and then using a rendering engine to draw these widgets on the screen.
Flutter also makes use of advanced layout algorithms, such as the box layout algorithm, which is used to determine the size and position of widgets within the app's user interface.
In addition to these algorithms, Flutter uses a variety of data structures to store and manage the app's data, including lists, maps, and sets. These data structures are used to store and organize the app's data in a way that is efficient and easy to access.
Used different approaches to design a responsive mobile app using Flutter
Used responsive widgets: Flutter includes a number of built-in widgets that automatically adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. For example, the Expanded widget takes up remaining free space, while the Flexible widget adjusts its size based on the space available.
Used a responsive layout: You can use a responsive layout to arrange your widgets in a way that adjusts to different screen sizes. One way to do this is to use a LayoutBuilder widget, which allows you to specify a callback function that returns a widget tree based on the constraints provided by the parent widget.
Used device-specific layouts: In some cases, you may want to design separate layouts for different devices or screen sizes. Flutter makes it easy to do this using device-specific widgets, such as LayoutBuilder, MediaQuery, and OrientationBuilder.
Used a responsive theme: You can also use a responsive theme to style your app in a way that adjusts to different screen sizes. Flutter includes a number of built-in themes that you can use as a starting point, or you can create your own custom theme.
